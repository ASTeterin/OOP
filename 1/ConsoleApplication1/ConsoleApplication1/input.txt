Finding somewhere affordable to live in Britain is hard. Some parts of the country are cheaper than others, of course, 
but the cost of renting a home is horrendous, especially in London and the South. Normally, the only answer is to share a 
house or a flat: you get a room of your own, but you have to share the kitchen and bathroom. In cities like Oxford and Cambridge, 
where rooms are scarce, prices will make your eyes water: more than £500 a month. In London, they’re even higher – not far off £700.
Oxford already seemed expensive when I lived there, and that was almost 40 years ago. When I started work after university, 
my room cost £40 a month – almost 15 per cent of my salary. With today’s rents in Oxford, you’d need to earn £40,000 a year if 
you didn’t want to spend more than 15 per cent on your room. But when you finish university, starting salaries are usually 
between £20,000 and £30,000.

Apart from the cost, shared flats and houses are often in poor condition. Landlords are slow to spend their profits on repairs. 
I was fairly lucky with mine. The house I lived in was scruffy, but the landlord took action when needed — like the time the 
bathroom ceiling fell in. I’d just run a bath and had returned to my room to get something, when I heard a loud crash. 
I went back to find the bathtub full of wet plaster. I had the ceiling repaired and took the bill to my landlord.
When people ask me how I learned to speak German, I tell them it was simple: I met a German man at the Oktoberfest, married him, 
and stayed in Munich for 20 years. But there’s a bit of a backstory, too. In 1973, my friend Sally and I decided to quit our jobs 
and travel through Europe. We boarded a plane in early September, determined to stay abroad as long as possible — stretching our 
money by hitchhiking and staying in youth hostels. Over the next eight months, we covered a lot of ground, from Greece and Turkey
to Finland, managing to limit our costs to an average of $5 a day. It all started in Luxembourg, when we walked to the edge of 
town and stuck out our thumbs. It wasn’t long before a group of US soldiers on motorcycles stopped. They were on their way to a 
wine festival on the Moselle River and were thrilled to have female companionship.

As 24-year-old American girls with backpacks, Sally and I rarely had to wait long for a ride. And although we often couldn’t 
understand the drivers, it didn’t matter. Wherever they were going was fine with us. Other than our plans to visit the Oktoberfest
in Munich, we had absolutely no itinerary. The advantage of this easygoing lifestyle was that we visited many villages that were 
far off the beaten path.
